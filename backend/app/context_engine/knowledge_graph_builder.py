Knowledge Graph Builder - Entity Extraction & Relationships

Constructs a knowledge graph from documents by extracting:
- Entities (people, places, concepts, products)
- Relationships (causes, enables, contradicts, extends)
- Temporal links (supersedes, evolves_from)
- Conditional edges (applies_when, except_if)
